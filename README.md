# Water-level-indicator

The project is based on embedded systems. 
PIC microcontroller has been used to program the water level indicator.
3 levels of water have been defined which are displayed by the LED.
if the water reaches a point higher than the acceptable threshold, the buzzer starts indicating that the power must be switched off.
